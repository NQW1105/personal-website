# NQW Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site, which I've hosted on Netlify.

It provides a brief introduction on my background and showcases the projects I've built during my self-taught journey. I'm continually learning and striving to improve my skills as a developer, so I'll be regularly updating the site.
